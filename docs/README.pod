=head1 ACTIONS

=over 4

=item B<map>

Create a mapping file for a gamepad.

=item B<pair>

Pair this computer with the host.

=item B<unpair>

Unpair this computer with the host.

=item B<stream>

Stream game from host to this computer.

=item B<list>

List all available games and application on host.

=item B<quit>

Quit the current running game or application on host.

=item B<help>

Show help for all available commands.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-config> [I<CONFIG>]

Load configuration file I<CONFIG>.
All options specified before B<-config> will be overwritten by the options in I<CONFIG>.
This options can be used multiple times.

=item B<-save> [I<CONFIG>]

Save the configuration provided by the options on the command line and all loaded configuration files to the file I<CONFIG>.

=item B<-720>

Use the resolution 1280x720 for streaming.
This is the default option.

=item B<-1080>

Use the resolution 1920x1080 for streaming.

=item B<-width> [I<WIDTH>]

Change the horizontal resolution to I<WIDTH>

=item B<-height> [I<HEIGHT>]

Change the vertical resolution to I<HEIGHT>

=item B<-30fps>

Use 30 fps for streaming.
This is the default configuration for 1080p and higher.

=item B<-60fps>

Use 60 fps for streaming.
This is the default configuration for 720p.

=item B<-fps> [I<FPS>]

Change the number of frame per second to I<FPS>

=item B<-bitrate> [I<BITRATE>]

Change bitrate to I<BITRATE> kbps.
By default the bitrate depends on the selected resolution and fps.
For resolution 1080p and 60 fps and higher 20 Mbps is used.
For resolution 1080p or 60 fps and higher 10 Mbps is used
For other configurations 5 Mbps is used by default.

=item B<-packetsize> [I<PACKETSIZE>]

Change the network packetsize to I<PACKETSIZE>.
The packetsize should the smaller than the MTU of the network.
By default a safe value of 1024 is used.

=item B<-forcehevc>

Request a h265/HEVC from the server.
Will still use h264 if server doesn't support HEVC.

=item B<-remote>

Enable the optimizations for remote connections in GFE.

=item B<-app> [I<APP>]

Change the requested app to execute to I<APP>.
By default Steam is started.

=item B<-nosops>

Stop GFE from changing the graphical settings of the requested game or application.

=item B<-localaudio>

Play the audio on the host instead of this computer.

=item B<-keydir> [I<DIRECTORY>]

Change the directory to save encryption keys to I<DIRECTORY>.
By default the encryption keys are stored in $XDG_CACHE_DIR/moonlight or ~/.cache/moonlight

=item B<-mapping> [I<MAPPING>]

Use I<MAPPING> as the mapping file for all inputs specified after this B<-mapping>.
If no B<-input> is specified after the B<-mapping> this mapping is used for autoloaded inputs.

=item B<-debug>

Enable verbose and debug output

=item B<-input> [I<INPUT>]

Enable the I<INPUT> device.
By default all available input devices are enabled.
Only evdev devices /dev/input/event* are supported.
To use a different gamepad mapping then the default the B<-mapping> should be specified before the B<-input>.

=item B<-audio> [I<DEVICE>]

Use <DEVICE> as audio output device.
The default value is 'sysdefault' for ALSA and 'hdmi' for OMX on the Raspberry Pi.

=head1 CONFIG FILE

Moonlight Embedded will load a confiuration file from:

  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/moonligt/moonlight.conf (fallback to ~/.config/moonligt/moonlight.conf)

If no user specified configuration file is available the configuration will be loaded from:

  /etc/moonlight/moonlight.conf

A documented example configuration file can be found at /etc/moonlight/moonlight.conf.

=head1 COMMENTS

Use Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Q to quit the streaming session.
